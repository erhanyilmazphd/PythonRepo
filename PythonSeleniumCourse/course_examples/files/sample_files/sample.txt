The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language, code, or images.
We offer a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to fine-tune your own custom models.
These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.
