Challenges of Non-Stationary Time Series
Non-stationary time series, on the other hand, exhibit changing statistical properties over time.
This makes them more challenging to work with and forecast. The main challenges associated with non-stationary time series are:

1- Trend: Non-stationary data often displays a trend, which is a long-term systematic movement in one direction,
either upward (an increasing trend) or downward (a decreasing trend).
Identifying and removing the trend is crucial for forecasting.

2- Seasonality: Seasonality is another common characteristic of non-stationary data.
It represents periodic fluctuations that occur at regular intervals, such as daily, monthly, or yearly patterns.
Accounting for seasonality is vital in making accurate forecasts.

3- Heteroscedasticity: Non-stationary time series often exhibit varying levels of volatility or variance over time.
This heteroscedasticity can make it difficult to develop forecasting models that assume constant variance.
-------------------------------

AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are widely used for non-stationary time series.
ARIMA models involve differencing the data to make it stationary and then
modeling it using autoregressive and moving average components.

Forecasting non-stationary time series typically involves a series of steps,
including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and plotting the results.
Hereâ€™s a Python code example for forecasting a non-stationary time series using the ARIMA model with a dataset and plots:
