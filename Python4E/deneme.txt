Space pollution, also known as space debris, is any man-made object in space that no longer serves a useful purpose.
This can include old satellites, rocket stages, and fragments from collisions or explosions.
There is growing concern about space pollution because it can pose a threat to functional satellites and spacecraft.
When debris is traveling at high speeds, even a small piece can cause significant damage.
In addition, the increasing amount of debris in space makes it more difficult and costly to launch new satellites
and perform other space-related activities. Some steps that are being taken to address the problem of
space pollution include the development of new technologies to track and remove debris, and the implementation
of guidelines to minimize the creation of new debris.
